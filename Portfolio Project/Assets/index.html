    <p>  Ola boa noite. Meu nombre esta James. That is portuguese for Good evening. my name is James. Yes I'm doing this project late at night,
         but I promise, I'm not procrastinating. I'm just finishing up degree and last month of my senior year of college. Other interesing things
         about me is that I'm an extremely active person. I love traveling,  working out in the gym, hiking, playing sports, and all means 
         I hate sitting in the house! One of the places I traveled to this year was Brazil, and I ended up learned the portuguese language before I went
         there pretty well. I had an amazing time, meet alot of new friends, and overall was one of the best experiences of my life.

            I was also a former collge baseball player at my school. I was a pitcher, and sadly I tore my rotator cuff
            rather badly, and had to stop playing baseball :( but life goes on! I still love the game very much, and watch
            all of the RedSox games when I have time. I'm also an enormous tennis fan, and love watcing Wimbledon while cheering 
            on Roger Federer. One day I'd like to go to London, and watch him play there. I also own a havanese poodle named tut 
            who is a rescue dog from Egypt.
